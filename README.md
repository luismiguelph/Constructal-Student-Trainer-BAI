# Project Title

Constructal-Student-Trainer-BAI

## Summary

Building ai course project on a constructal student trainer for focusing and avoiding procrastination

## Background

The constructal theory was stated by Professor Adrian Bejan in late XX century, and is related to system flow optimization in Nature and Engineering, that provide tree shape configuration optimization.  When a student works hard on subjects, wants to optimize the flow of ideas on the brains tree shape neural network, but procrastination will make it harder, with distractions like social apps; plenty of interruptions; other obligations; etc., that will create over flows on theirs systems of neurons and/or mental blocks.

## How is it used?

An AI program is needed, to train the students, from schools to universities, to overcome procrastination and inefficiencies on their studies organization so they can improve themselves.

## Data sources and AI methods

The program would gadder information on the work needed to be accomplished by the student plus number of hours effective work  and cross reference with the activities not related with the goals, like social apps behavior, interruptions on work; screen suck  on the computer of mobile phone. The program could give warning signs and also tips how to be more concentrated like enjoying a chocolate while studding so the brain associates the pleasure of chocolate to the studding activities.

## Challenges

This kind of program would be of interest to students of any level, from schools to universities so the buyers are students, parents, psychologists, behavioral scientists.
Probably a support from teachers, parents, psychologists and other professional that will help the students analyze the program reports and give insights on how to improve their studying.

## What next?

From students training for more study efficiency or productivity can grow to the health sector so that the program could also be improved to be prescribed.
